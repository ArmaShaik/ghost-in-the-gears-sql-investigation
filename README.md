# 🕵️ Ghost in the Gears – SQL Murder Mystery Investigation

This project follows a multi-stage, Snowflake-based investigation where I played the role of a data analyst solving a fictional murder mystery. The story unfolds across 6 assignments, each building on the last, applying SQL skills to track clues, examine patterns, and narrow down suspects.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Snowflake SQL**
- **S3 + Staging + COPY INTO**
- **Views, CTEs, and Role-Based Access**
- **ETL (ghosts_csv + ghosts_pipe formats)**
- **Resource Monitors and Statement Timeouts**
- **JSON Parsing and Variant Data**
- **Data Joins and Filtering for Homicide Analysis**

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Data loading and staging from Amazon S3
- Complex JOINs and subqueries to link suspects and evidence
- Use of views to isolate victim call patterns
- JSON parsing of video surveillance activity
- Role creation and permission control for warehouse access
- Resource monitor setup and warehouse usage auditing

## 📂 File Overview

| File                     | Description                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `full_investigation.sql` | All SQL code used to solve the investigation     |

## 🔍 Outcome

Using call logs, victim profiles, video footage, and forum posts, I identified patterns linking city officials to AI-related content and suspicious calls to homicide victims — narrowing down a list of likely suspects.
